## Hi! I'm Tia Giron, and I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer!

I am excited to be learning and expanding my skillset as a student in TripleTen's Software Engineering program and am gradually building up my repository and experience in projects. Some of my skills so far include: HTML/CSS, Git, GitHub, VSCode, Figma, and JavaScript. I'm also experienced in the React framework, MongoDB, creating API requests, as well as setting up a database and creating tests. I've been able to utilize my knowledge in various projects displayed on GitHub. 
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently working on TripleTen's Software Engineering bootcamp
- ðŸ’š Iâ€™m interested in sustainable web development and design
- ðŸŒˆ Pronouns: she/her
- ðŸŒ± Fun fact: I have my Masters in Nutritional Science from the University of Texas at Austin, and hope to combine this passion with my new skillset in web development!
