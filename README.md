## Hi! I'm Tia Giron!

I am a Software Engineer and Data Analyst Trainee with a Master’s degree (GPA 4.0) and a passion for building intentional, data-informed solutions. After graduating from TripleTen’s Software Engineering program, I’ve expanded my focus into the world of Big Data and Analytics through Revature, where I translate complex logic into actionable insights.

💻 Full-Stack: I build scalable web applications using the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).
📊 Data & Analytics: I’m currently focused on Python (Pandas), SQL (CTEs, Window Functions), and the Big Data stack (Hadoop, Hive, Spark).

- 💚 I’m interested in sustainable web development and design
- 🌈 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌱 Fun fact: I have my Masters in Nutritional Science from the University of Texas at Austin, and hope to combine this passion with my new skillset in web development!
